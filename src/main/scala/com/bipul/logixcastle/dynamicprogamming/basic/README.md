**There are two properties that can inter that the problem may be solved by Dynamic programming.**

##### [(1) Overlapping Subproblems.](https://github.com/dasbipulkumar/LogixCastle/tree/master/src/main/scala/com/bipul/logixcastle/dynamicprogamming/basic/overlappingsubproblem)
##### [(2) Optimal Substructure.](https://github.com/dasbipulkumar/LogixCastle/tree/master/src/main/scala/com/bipul/logixcastle/dynamicprogamming/basic/optimalsubstructure)


**There are two approaches to solve**
